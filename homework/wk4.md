Exercise
=========

To complete these exercises, use the wk3 homework template in your repo.

- Make a loop that console.logs the numbers 1 - 1000
- Ask the user a yes-no question using `prompt`. Store the answer in a variable.
- Write an if...then statement so that if you user input 'yes' the program adds the class 'yes' to the body of the page, or adds the class 'no' if the user enters 'no'. Add some css so the page background changes based on the class.

Do one of the following:

- Math.rand() gives you a random number from 0-1. Write a program that prompts the user for a "max" number and then prompts the user for the number of times they would like a number generated. Using a for loop, print 'n' random numbers no higher than the user's max. For instance, if the user enters 37 as max, and wants 4 numbers, the program might log 15, 33, 11, 9. You definitely wouldn't find a number higher than 37, or any more numbers than 4. You can think of this as a lotto number generator that will work for any lotto.
- Do the [FizzBuzz](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#p_i0Cvwf75cQ) problem from the reading.
