Excercises
==========

- Implement http://typehere.co/. Store the text in localstorage. Make it yours by designing it differently or adding a feature. For instance, allow the user to change fonts or font size, background color. What about a "clear all". Or get really advanced: how about find and replace?
- Put your implementation on the web somewhere.
