Midterm:
========

We've been working on Javascript basics for a few weeks and doing weekly exercises. This has helped you build up some bits and pieces, but it's hard to really start putting things together without working on a bigger, cohesive project.

Your midterm assignment is an open project. You can build anything you want, you just have to use Javascript. Here are the rules:

- The entire thing will be due on Nov 3. On that day, we'll quickly go around and you'll show off your project in class. But you'll have to show work along the way.
- By next week (Sept 29) you need to have made a new Github repository and created a file called README.md in it. In this file, write the name of your project and a brief description. Don't worry, you can change it at any time. Just get something in there. On this day, we'll quickly go around the classroom and say our project ideas.
- Each week you need to commit something to the repository so I can see some progress.
- Do your best to make the project reflect what you've learned. 

__Some Ideas__

Its hard to come up with a project idea. Here are some things to consider:

__Keep it simple!__ Even simple things take a lot of work. 
__Try to think of a high level category you'd be interested in__. Do you want to make a piece of Art? A tool to solve a problem? A Game? 

Here are some examples to get your mind going. I would say most of these are too complex to do, so don't think you need to do match them.

When you're creating your project, try to make something that starts small but can get bigger. This way, you can shoot for the smallest goal, but if it turns out to be easy, start adding features.

__Design counts!__ Give your project a frame. Think how it will be communicated to me and your class mates and spend some time making it look nice.
