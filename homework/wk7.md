## Reading

If you want to know a lot more about Ajax, read [Chapter 17](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html) of Eloquent Javascript. Note it deals with the plain javascript version of Ajax and doesn't touch on jQuery. But this is what jQuery is doing under the hood.

You might also want to read the entire jQuery [Ajax documentation](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/).

## Exercise

- Sign up for a api key with the NY Times.
- Use ajax to request one of the following [NY Times Apis](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs): (bestsellers, events, geographic, most popular, movie reviews, times newswire, semantic).
- Display the information on a webpage.
- Bonus: the apis let you change the data you request by adding information to the 'data' you send over. Make a simple interface that allows a user to change this data. For instance, allow the user to input a search term, set a date range, etc. To find out what you can send over, read the documentation under 'Optional Parameters' for whatever API you've chosen.
